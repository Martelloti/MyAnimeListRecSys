# MyAnimeList Recommender System
This project was initially built for the Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree.

#### Project Status: Active

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to develop the best suitable collaborative filtering user-based recommender system for the [MyAnimeList](www.myanimelist.net) portal. MyAnimeList is currently the most relevant portal for Anime and Manga content and today it counts with over 4M users interacting and scoring the available shows.

### Methods Used
* Collaborative filtering application (Recommendation system)

### Technology needed for the project to work
* Python 3.6
* Notebook Jupyter
* scikit-surprise 1.0.6 
* Pandas 0.24.2
* Numpy 1.16.2
* Scipy 1.21
* Matplotlib 3.0.3
* The datasets used in the project are all available in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/azathoth42/myanimelist)

## Project Content

As from today, this project relies on 
* Do some exploration so the profile of the MyAnimeList users could be understood
* Make all the data cleaning and wrangling needed so the collaborative filtering algorithms could be tested
* Train and test all the available algorithms at the chosen lib and choose the best performing one
* Create an easy way of checking the recommendations for each user and even develop a MVP of an item-based recommender
